# Whatsapp Bot
Hi Humans, Im Dee from BerPesan! & Emerald-Group Back-End Developer. This is my first github page, On this first topic i would teach you how you to create your own
Whatsapp Bot.

First of all let me explain what is <code>WhatsApp Bot</code> is, In general Bot is a robot that works by the program create by us. So whatsapp bot is a robot program that
we created.

Lets Start,



First of all lets get the WhatsApp bot service first on Atlantic-Group.id, Purchase their WhatsApp bot service first, Before you purchase make sure you make your hook
web page system on your website, Here is the hook code

<p>-------=--------</p>
<li>- You can name your hook as https://yourweb/bot/hook.php</li>
I recommended you to make a file name /bot/program-bot (replace program-bot with your program name)

For checking the hook file you may check at my pastebin page by <a href="https://pastebin.com/embed_iframe/m6KJwkm0">Clicking Here</a>

Before you creating your hook, Create a file first named AtlanticWhatsApp.php at your /lib/. Please make sure file name is same so it will sincronized to Atlantic-Group Server
You may look the coding by <a href="https://pastebin.com/embed_iframe/s3n25jpK">Clicking Here</a>, The file is ready to be used.
The last step put this code in your config file, (the file to connect your web to databases) by <a href="https://pastebin.com/embed_iframe/wghxLJCq">Clicking Here</a>

For your set config main you are done. now we proceed to our bot program

<b><p>First of all make sure you named the bot file with cmd-<b>your-file-name<b> after that do not forgot to put cmd-<b>your-file-name</b> on the hook,</p> if you forgot where to put
